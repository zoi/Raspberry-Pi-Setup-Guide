# Raspberry Pi Setup Guide

A really opionionated guide how to setup a Raspberry Pi (1 or 2) with Arch Linux including WiringPi, NTP, Wi-Fi, SSH,
Ruby, ZSH and more.

Take a look into the wiki for more interesing stuff like finding out your Raspberry Pi version.


## Some words regarding the hardware

I recommend you to get a speed class 10 SD Card with more than 4 GB capacity for optimal performance.

Additionally you should buy a small heatsink. [Something like that](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=raspberry%20pi%20heatsink&sprefix=raspberry+pi+he%2Caps&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Araspberry%20pi%20heatsink) and attach it to the CPU of the Raspberry Pi.


## What you'll need

- A linux machine with a working SD card slot
- `bsdtar` or `tar`, `fdisk`


## 1. Setup the SD card
### 1.1. Format the SD card with fdisk

Replace `/dev/sdX` with the SD Card device. Make sure that the device is the SD card and not your harddrive, otherwise
you'll destroy your linux installation! You can see which device you'll have to use by running `dmesg` after putting the
SD card into the slot.

1. Start `fdisk` via `sudo fdisk /dev/sdX`.
2. At the fdisk prompt, delete existing partitions: Type `o`. This will clear out any partitions on the drive. Then type
   `p` to list partitions. There should be no partitions left.
3. Type `n`, then `p` for primary, `1` for the first partition on the drive, press `ENTER` to accept the default first
   sector, then type `+100M` for the last sector.
4. Type `t`, then `c` to set the first partition to type `W95 FAT32 (LBA)`.
5. Type `n`, then `p` for primary, `2` for the second partition on the drive, and then press `ENTER` twice to accept
   the default first and last sector.
6. Write the partition table and exit by typing `w`.
7. Now create a FAT filesystem: `mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1` and mount the new boot partition via
   `mkdir boot && sudo mount /dev/sdX1 boot`
8. Also create the ext4 filesystem for the root partition: `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX2` and mount it:
   `mkdir root && sudo mount /dev/sdX2 root`



### 1.2. Download the image from the website

There are 2 major versions of Raspberry Pi now. You may find the downloads on
[www.archlinuxarm.org](http://www.archlinuxarm.org) for the latest version of Arch Linux for Raspberry Pi both 1 and 2.


**For Raspberry Pi 2**

```bash
wget http://archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz
sudo tar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz -C root
sync
```


**For Raspberry Pi 1**

```bash
wget http://archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz
sudo tar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz -C root
sync
```


### 1.3. Write the files onto the SD Card

```bash
sudo mv root/boot/* boot/
sudo unmount boot root
```


### 1.4. Put the SD Card into your pi, power it on and login with alarm/alarm

You can have connected a keyboard via USB and some kind of screen via HDMI or you can connect to the Pi via SSH after
it's booted.


## 2. Basic system setup
### 2.1. German keyboard layout and timezone

Of course just if you want to have a german keyboard layout. You may skip this step or use another layout.

```bash
loadkeys de
echo LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
echo KEYMAP=de-latin1-nodeadkeys > /etc/vconsole.conf
rm /etc/localtime
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin /etc/localtime
sed -i "s/en_US.UTF-8/#en_US.UTF-8/" /etc/locale.conf
```

```bash
export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
```


### 2.2. Setup swapfile

```bash
fallocate -l 1024M /swapfile
chmod 600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
echo 'vm.swappiness=1' > /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf
```

* Then add the following line to `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0
```


### 2.3. Set hardware clock to UTC and set timezone

```bash
timedatectl set-local-rtc 0

nano /etc/timezone
```

* Set to "Europe/Berlin"


## 3. Update system and enable NTP
### 3.1. Tweak pacman

```bash
sed -i 's/#Color/Color/' /etc/pacman # Add color to pacman
```


### 3.2. System update

```bash
pacman -Sy pacman
pacman-key --init
pacman -S archlinux-keyring
pacman-key --populate archlinux
pacman -Syu --ignore filesystem
pacman -S filesystem --force
reboot
```


### 3.3. NTP

```bash
pacman -S ntp
systemctl enable ntpd.service
systemctl start ntpd.service
```


## 4. Advanced setup
### 4.1. Set a secure root passwd

```bash
passwd
```


### 4.2. Set hostname

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname your-hostname
```


### 4.3. sudo & user

```bash
pacman -S sudo vim
visudo
```

* Search for following line and uncomment it:

```bash
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

* Then install adduser

```bash
pacman -S adduser
```

* Add a new user. The additional groups are `rvm` and `wheel`

```bash
adduser
```

### 4.4. Additional software

* Log out and log in with our newly created user

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed nfs-utils htop openssh autofs alsa-utils alsa-firmware alsa-lib alsa-plugins git zsh zsh-grml-config base-devel diffutils libnewt
```


* Install yaourt:

```bash
wget https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pa/package-query/package-query.tar.gz
tar -xvzf package-query.tar.gz
cd package-query
makepkg -si
cd ..
wget https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ya/yaourt/yaourt.tar.gz
tar -xvzf yaourt.tar.gz
cd yaourt
makepkg -si
```


### 4.5 vcgencmd and other vc tools

```bash
vim /etc/profile
```

Change the line saying `PATH=`:

```bash
# Set our default path
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/vc/sbin:/opt/vc/bin"
export PATH
```


### 4.6 WiringPi

```bash
sudo git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi /opt/wiringpi
cd /opt/wiringpi
sudo ./build

gpio -v
gpio readall
```

* The last both command should give an `ok` or something similar. If not, something may be broken.



## 5. Sound

Set the output device

```bash
amixer cset numid=3 1
```



## 6. Raspberry Pi overclocking

You may want to overclock the Pi. And you won't even lose the guarantee for your pi, if you use the "offical"
overclocking presets. The simplest way to overclock the pi is `rasp-config` tool which ships with the offical allowed
overclocking presets.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/chattama/raspi-config-archlinux/archlinux/raspi-config
```

Get to the overclocking menu and choose the overclocking preset you want. I recommend the "high" preset. After changing
the overclocking preset, reboot your raspberry pi.



## 7. Wi-Fi

```bash
wifi-menu -o
netctl start yourWifiSSID
netctl enable yourWifiSSID
```


## 9. Ruby

```bash
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
useradd -G rvm benny
yaourt -S ruby
rvm reload
rvm install ruby
rvm list
rvm alias create default ruby-2.3.0 # Or something else depending on what rvm list says
gem install bundler
```


## 10. ZSH and dotfiles

If you want to use ZSH
```bash
sudo usermod -s /usr/bin/zsh
```

Additionally you may want to clone and setup your personal dotfiles.

* Logout and login back again or just reboot the pi


## 11. Tweaks
### 11.1 TRIM and noatime

Change in your fstab:

```
/dev/root  /  ext4  noatime,discard  0  0
```


### 11.2 Disable tmpfs for /tmp

Since our RAM is limited.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop tmp.mount
sudo systemctl disable tmp.mount
```
